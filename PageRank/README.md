PageRank Implementation



A simple version of the PageRank algorithm was implemented using a binary adjacency matrix, where "1" entries represent links between nodes. Starting from a uniform rank vector, the algorithm iteratively updated the ranks through matrix multiplications until the changes fell below a given threshold. At each step, the rank distribution was displayed graphically, showing the progression toward convergence.
